# Improved-fighting-game
Original game by Chris Courses (YouTube). You can view the original here https://chriscourses-fighting-game.netlify.app/. I have used his original code and added more features and just improved some of the the current gameplay. In this version, you have a start button, which will take start the game and you can also turn your player so, it isn't stuck to being able to fight in one direction.
(! Important !) When you look at the controls for the game (by using the pause button and viewing the controls) you will see many different attacks but only the normal attack works as of now (I didn't want to make the others).
